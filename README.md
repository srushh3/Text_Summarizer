A Text Summarizer condenses long pieces of text into shorter, more meaningful summaries while retaining key information. It helps in extracting essential details from articles, documents, or web content efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Text Summarization

Extractive Summarization â€“ Selects the most important sentences from the original text (BERT-based).
eg: T5 Summarization (Abstractive Approach)

Abstractive Summarization â€“ Generates new sentences by paraphrasing the original text (T5-based).
eg: BERT Summarization (Extractive Approach)

ðŸ”¹ Project Explanation

1. Handles multiple input types: Extracts text from .txt, .pdf, and website URLs.
2. Uses pdf2image & pytesseract: Converts PDFs into images and extracts text using OCR.
3. Pretrained T5 model and Bert Model: Uses T5 Transformer (t5-base) for abstractive summarization (paraphrasing & rewording) and BERT Extractive Summarizer selects the most important sentences instead of paraphrasing.
4. Fuzzy Matching (find_near_matches): Finds approximate matches of summary sentences in the original text.
