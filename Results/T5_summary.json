As of this newsletter, HB44\nhas passed the House and is awaiting Senate action. If passed, the Board would no longer issue a\n\u201ccertificate only\u201d but would require all applicants to qualify for a permit to practice (license) by meeting\nthe 4-Es \u2014 Education, Examination, Experience, & Ethics.\n\nCurrently, a \u201ccertificate only\u201d is mostly used by foreign applicants who do not reside in the US and have\ndifficulty getting a US CPA to attest to their experience to meet the requirements for a permit to\npractice, but Montana residence can and do apply for the \u201ccertificate only\u201d too. The Board considers\nthe two-tier system confusing to the public and is trying to eliminate the confusion. The public doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily understand the qualification and restrictions for a \u201ccertificate only\u201d and assumes a CPA is a\nCPA. Some \u201ccertificate only\u201d licensees don\u2019t necessarily understand the restrictions either.\n\nThe draft language contains a transition period for current \u201ccertificate only\u201d licensees to obtain the\nnecessary experience to elevate to the permit to practice level of licensure. The experience\nrequirement to obtain a permit to practice is 2000 hours of accounting and auditing functions ordinarily\nrequired in the practice of public accounting within the preceding 3 years. Experience can come from\nprivate, governmental, academic, or public accounting work.\n\nAll applicable experience must be attested to by a US CPA in good standing with an active license at the\ntime of attestation. The CPA attesting to the experience does not need to be a supervisor, but must be\nfamiliar with the applicant\u2019s work and be able to attest that the work meets professional standards. The\nBoard may also consider military experience by evaluating information provided by the applicant\u2019s\ncommanding officer, outlining the duties and responsibilities of the applicant while in military service.",
